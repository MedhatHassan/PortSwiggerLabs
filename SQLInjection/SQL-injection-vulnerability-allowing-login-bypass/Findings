The proccess of login is like this: 
USER req => db check => db responce (true or false) => if true login else wrong credentials
So we try to bypass the db  check and return true via:
Edit USER req with correct USER NAME (administrator) and comment the password.
The payload is : SELLECT * FROM users WHERE username='administrator'--' AND password='anyThing'
